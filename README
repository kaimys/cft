This is the a CFT version optimized for HbbTV. You can use the yellow and blue button to scroll up and down and the red one as a back button and the green one to reload the page. The result of the tests will be sent back to the server as a JSON string.

Common Feature Tests (CFT) aims to provide a convenient set of feature tests (duh!) for Javascript (and JScript). It eliminates a need for browser sniffing, providing a much more robust way to work around environment quirks. None of the tests require presence of `document.body` and so can be run at any time.
